# CloudMark API v1

Default base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/v1`.

Read operations are available on loopback. Write operations require:

```http
X-CloudMark-Token: <token printed by cloudmark serve>
```

## Create an inventory run

```http
POST /api/v1/runs
Content-Type: application/json
X-CloudMark-Token: ...

{"suite":"inventory","profile":"default"}
```

The response is `202 Accepted`. Poll `/runs/{id}` until the state is
`completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`.

While running, the response includes `progress`, `phase`, `current_job`,
`completed_steps`, `total_steps`, `heartbeat_at`, and version fields for the
runner, methodology, and measurement tool. Storage results are updated after
each completed fio job so a failed or cancelled run preserves partial evidence.

## Create a storage run

```json
{
  "suite": "storage",
  "profile": "disk-quick",
  "confirm_write": true,
  "timeout_seconds": 600
}
```

`confirm_write` is mandatory because even safe filesystem mode writes a
temporary file. The API rejects the run if `fio` is unavailable or the safety
reserve cannot be maintained.

Supported storage profiles are `disk-quick`, `disk-standard`, `disk-database`,
`disk-throughput`, and `disk-sustained`.

## Cancel a run

```http
POST /api/v1/runs/run_123/cancel
Content-Type: application/json
X-CloudMark-Token: ...

{}
```

Cancellation is accepted only for `queued` or `running` runs. The runner stops
the active child process, removes temporary files, preserves completed job
results, and changes the run state to `cancelled`.

## Pair two provider agents

1. `POST /sessions` with the controller token.
2. Copy the returned session ID and short-lived join token to each agent.
3. Each agent calls `/sessions/{id}/join` with a role: `target`, `generator`,
   `replica`, or `peer`.
4. Read `/sessions/{id}` to verify topology.

The complete machine-readable contract is in
[`openapi/cloudmark-v1.yaml`](../openapi/cloudmark-v1.yaml).
